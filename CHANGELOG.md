# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0-rc.0]

### Breaking Changes

- Rename the project and crates from Oxanus to Oxana. Use `oxana`, `oxana-macros`, `oxana-web`, and `#[oxana(...)]` in manifests, imports, derive attributes, examples, and dashboard integrations.
- Move enqueue-time metadata onto `#[derive(oxana::Job)]`. Job identity, conflict handling, resurrection, throttle cost, on-demand exposure, and worker binding now belong to the job type; custom job hooks now resolve `Self` as the job type.
- Route every worker through the batch-capable execution path. Manual worker implementations now provide `run_batch`, while derive users can keep writing `process` for single-job workers or opt into `process_batch`.
- Own job values during execution instead of borrowing them, so job payload types no longer need to implement `Sync`.

### Added

- Add batch workers with `#[oxana(batch_size = ..., batch_timeout_ms = ...)]`, `process_batch`, `BatchItem`, and `WorkerBatchConfig` for high-throughput workloads that can process jobs together.
- Add on-demand jobs: annotate a job with `#[oxana(on_demand)]` to expose it in the web dashboard with editable JSON arguments and type-aware argument templates.
- Add worker execution metrics, including per-minute success, failure, panic, execution-time, and histogram data through `Storage::job_metrics`, `Storage::job_metrics_for`, and the new `/metrics` dashboard pages.
- Add queue length history, per-queue processing rates, growth rates, effective drain rates, and ETA estimates to the stats APIs and dashboard.
- Add `REDIS_STATS_URL`, `build_from_redis_urls`, and `build_from_pools` so counters and metrics can use a separate Redis instance from the primary job store.
- Add dashboard actions for enqueueing cron jobs immediately and wiping the dead queue.

### Changed

- Make dashboard queue and metrics views more operationally useful: queue length charts now live with queue stats, tooltips use readable worker labels, zero-value tooltip rows are hidden, and unknown ETAs sort after known drain times.
- Reduce Redis pressure by replacing `KEYS` with cursor-based `SCAN`, batching result counter writes, and snapshotting active queue lengths during worker refreshes.
- Improve on-demand registration so the dashboard can prefill arguments, keep job hooks intact, and choose a sensible default queue.
- Refresh examples, package metadata, CI paths, documentation references, and dependency versions for the Oxana rename and 2.0 release candidate.

### Fixed

- Store `scheduled_at` in job metadata when scheduling jobs with `enqueue_at`

## [1.0.5]

### Added

- Per-queue stats API: `stats_queues()` and `stats_queues_for(patterns)` for fetching queue-level statistics independently

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- Public release

## [0.10.0]

**Breaking release.** See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the upgrade guide.

### Added

- **Job/Worker separation**: job data (`Job` trait) is now separate from processing logic (`Worker<Args>` trait)
- `FromContext` trait for injecting app state into workers (auto-derived for unit and single-field structs)
- `JobContext` replaces generic `Context<T>`
- `ContextValue::new(x)` replaces `Context::value(x)`
- `#[oxana(job = Type)]` attribute with `{Name}Job` convention default (strips `Worker` suffix)

### Changed

- `#[derive(oxana::Worker)]` now generates both `Job` and `Worker<Args>` impls
- `config.register_worker::<W, J>()` replaces `config.register_worker::<W>()`
- `storage.enqueue(queue, job)` now takes the job struct, not the worker struct
- Cron `queue` attribute is now required at compile time (was runtime panic)
- `job_envelope::Job` struct renamed to `JobData`
- `Processable`/`BoxedProcessable` removed from public API

### Removed

- `Context<T>` generic context wrapper
- `register_cron_worker` (use `register_worker` with cron attributes)
- `test_helper.rs` (replaced by inline test utilities)
