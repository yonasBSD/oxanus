# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0]

**Breaking release.** See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the 1.x -> 2.x upgrade guide.

### Major Changes

- Rename the project and crates from Oxanus to Oxana. Use `oxana`, `oxana-macros`, `oxana-web`, and `#[oxana(...)]` in manifests, imports, derive attributes, examples, and dashboard integrations.
- Replace the `Config`-first setup flow with a typed runtime API. `Storage` now focuses on enqueueing, scheduling, metrics, and monitoring; `storage.runtime(ctx)` handles queue and worker registration, runtime settings, `run()`, `drain(queue)`, and `catalog()`.
- Move persisted job identity and enqueue-time metadata onto the job type. Runtime registrations now map job types to workers, while unique IDs, conflict handling, resurrection, retry-state resume, throttle cost, and on-demand exposure are defined by `Job`.
- Keep a migration path for existing Redis data by registering legacy worker-name aliases, so 2.x runtimes can consume queued, scheduled, retry, and dead jobs written by 1.x workers.
- Route workers through a batch-capable execution path. Workers now receive owned job values, manual implementations provide `process` or `run_batch`, and job payloads no longer need to implement `Sync`.
- Simplify queue definitions. Static queues no longer need `Serialize`, dynamic queues use an explicit `discovery_interval`, and manual dynamic queues must provide their own `key()`.
- Simplify structured progress to cursor/total state. `JobProgress` no longer exposes a separate `processed` field, and progress helpers use `(cursor, total)` or `(cursor, total, note)`.
- Remove deprecated or unused public surface, including legacy `JobMeta` timestamp helpers, `JobMetricsTotals::execution_seconds`, `JobProgressIterator::current_index`, and the never-raised `OxanaError::JobPanicked` variant. `OxanaError` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.

### New Features

- Add batch workers with `#[oxana(batch_size = ..., batch_timeout_ms = ...)]`, derived `process_batch`, `BatchItem`, and `WorkerBatchConfig`.
- Add `Storage::enqueue_list` for enqueueing multiple jobs to the same queue in one call while preserving unique-job conflict behavior.
- Add on-demand dashboard jobs with `#[oxana(on_demand)]`, editable JSON argument templates, and manual enqueueing from the web UI.
- Add job execution metrics through `Storage::job_metrics`, `Storage::job_metrics_for`, execution-time histograms, and new `/metrics` dashboard pages.
- Add queue length history, per-queue processing rates, growth rates, effective drain rates, ETA estimates, and sortable queue/metrics dashboard tables.
- Add 24-hour metrics windows with retention and chart downsampling for longer dashboard views.
- Add structured progress APIs with `ctx.state.update_progress(...)`, `ctx.state.progress()`, `ctx.state.iter_with_progress(...)`, `JobProgressIterator`, and progress bars/ETAs in the dashboard.
- Add runtime queue controls with persisted queue state and dynamic concurrency overrides: `QueueConfig::dynamic_concurrency(...)`, `Storage::set_queue_concurrency`, `Storage::set_queue_state`, `pause_queue`, `unpause_queue`, and `reset_queue_config`, plus dashboard controls for supported queues.
- Add bulk operational actions for recovering jobs: retry all pending retries, revive all dead jobs, wipe the dead queue, enqueue cron jobs immediately, and re-enqueue jobs from dashboard job lists.
- Add runtime tuning setters for worker heartbeat, resurrection/failover thresholds, Redis failure tolerance, retry/schedule/cron polling, dequeue and dispatcher backoff, throttled queue fallback wait, and shutdown timeout.
- Add storage builder conveniences, including `Storage::from_env`, `Storage::from_url`, `build_from_redis_urls`, `build_from_pools`, and `REDIS_STATS_URL` for storing counters and metrics separately from the primary job store.
- Improve Redis-side scalability by using cursor-based scans for queue discovery, batching result counter writes, and snapshotting active queue lengths during worker refreshes.
